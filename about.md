# About Me

I'm Daniel Bodnar, a software engineer with a passion for building useful things.

## What I Do

I work across the full stack, with particular interests in:

- **Web Development** — Building responsive, accessible, and performant web applications
- **Cloud Infrastructure** — Designing and deploying scalable systems
- **Developer Tools** — Creating tools that make development more enjoyable

## Philosophy

I believe in writing code that's simple, readable, and maintainable. The best solutions are often the most straightforward ones.

## This Site

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a simple and powerful static site generator. It's fast, minimal, and easy to maintain — just the way I like it.
