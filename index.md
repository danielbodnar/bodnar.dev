# Hey, I'm Daniel

**Platform Engineer | Systems Architect | SRE | Linux Evangelist**

Self-motivated, passionate, and incredibly curious automator with **30 years of full-stack software engineering** and **22+ years of infrastructure/systems engineering experience**. I am constantly growing, evolving, and improving. My curiosity and innovation thrive on the cutting edge, but my seasoned experience anchors my solutions to the boringly-stable.

## What I Bring

I bring **three decades of cross-domain expertise** spanning the entire software engineering ecosystem—from low-level systems programming and infrastructure automation to application development and enterprise architecture. This breadth enables me to identify solutions and optimize systems in ways that specialists confined to a single domain cannot.

I thrive in **high-pace, rapidly evolving environments** that require continual learning and absorbing large amounts of information. I really enjoy identifying abstract connections, which has served me well in time-sensitive, high-pressure situations where understanding the underlying root cause quickly can mean the difference between a minor incident and a major outage.

## My Greatest Strength

I have an insatiable drive to solve complex challenges. My greatest strength is not merely my current knowledge or prior experience, but my **ability to quickly grasp new concepts and learn anything** by diving into the deep end and mucking around, and then bringing order out of chaos. I come alive when given the opportunity to automate mundane, repetitive tasks and thrive in continually evolving environments or with frequent change.

> In my experience, in order to truly know what a tool does well, you must first understand what it does not do well.
